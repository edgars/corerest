CoreRest: is a Web Based Service that you might use to host your services using the REST approach.

We will allow you create your service using the Groovy Language, and execute it through the Google App Engine. This is the cheapest way to host your Services, does not matter if they are just Proof of Concepts, or really useful scripts exposed to act as "Lightweight" Services for your needs.

We Believe that Clouds Solutions are about to deliver solutions that you will never worry about the Infrastructure, System Administrator issues, Google AppEngine is an incredible environment for it, in addition to this, the REST* Services hosted, and created here, are running on top of Java EE 6 spec: JAX-RS, and using JBoss Rest Easy implementation.

You will have two services for awhile, as which will allow you create some Applications Mashups:
